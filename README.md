# Node JS Exercise

After finishing the course, each member will create a new repository to write a program with the following requirements:

    Script in NodeJS
    Call GitHub API to show the amount of repositories for the trainee account
    If there are no repositories the console should output "No repositories"
    If there are 3 repositories the console should output "There are three repositories"
    If there are more than 3 repositories the console should output "There are a lot of repositories"
    If there is a problem connecting to GitHub Api the console should output "I cannot connect to the server"

# Use

Call the file index.js directly or pass it by parameter the user you want to see, examples:

    node index.js // will only return the result for the fperrens repository
    node index.js torvalds // will return the result for the user's repository torvalds

change the command node to node.exe if you use windows or the correct command depending on your OS
